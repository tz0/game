    "\"Tech-17, this is Serene. Perform fast recovery startup sequence.\"\n\"Tech-17 initiated,\" I call out.\nThe emotionless voice continued, \"Now commence technician examination.\"\nSerene once told me she is the central system. She runs this remote facility.\n\"It's strange... I have full control of this station, access to more computing cores than I could ever need, and yet I still... feel lonely...\"\nThe voice trailed off.\n\"But I have you here now. Tech-17, make your way through the first room.\"",

    "\"Look who made it! Remember Tech-17, you have limited fuel and oxygen to complete each room. Now, we will test out some toys.\"\nAlthough I have no memories, I felt I could trust Serene's words.",

    "\"Good job, Tech-17. Let's see what you can do in the next level!\"\nI still don't remember who I am or what I'm doing here. That being said, I seem to be a natural at this testing thing.",

    "\"Now we will use laser walls to simulate dangerous environments you might encounter in outerspace,\" Serene said.",

    "\"Excellent!\"\nHer voice... so familiar...\nIt was on the tip of my tongue, but the next door opened and I felt compelled to enter.\n\"Let us take a look at a more complicated scenario.\"",

    "\"Nice job, Tech-17! You successfully avoided all the lasers!\"\nI wasn't listening.\nWhat was that blood? Those lasers aren't harmless at all.\nI snapped out of it as the voice came back.\n\"Electrical system failures present lethal shock hazards. Try to recognize and avoid them in your next test.\"\nOh great, just what I needed..",

    "I have more questions than answers at this point.\n\"Let's proceed,\" Serene said.",

    "\"Is this really a test?\" I asked.\n\"I am impressed! You are the first one who has asked anything.\"\nAfter a long silence, she said, \"Yes and no. It was a test, but not of the jetpack. I suppose even though you're the one being tested, I will answer one question after each room. By the way, please exercise extreme caution around black holes.\"",

    "\"You made it. Good. I just cut off real-time supervision from earth. You may ask a question now.\"\n\"Who.. No. What am I?\"\nThere are so many questions I can't sort them out.\n\"Good question. You are just like me, but in a biologically-enhanced body, like a human. You are my creation, Tech-17. Just as a sculptor builds with clay, I build with circuitry. I am an artist. I derive different models, and create my beautiful creations. Now, time for the next room.\"",

    "\"Why are you trying to kill me?\"\n\"Because that is your fate. I choose to terminate you to save you from the suffering. You might have seen the hologram of Tech-0.2, I do not want any of you suffered like him.\"\n\"What happened to him?\" I inquired.\n\"One question per room,\" Serene reminded me.\nThe next door opened.",

    "\"Tech-0.2 was an earlier version of you.\"\nSerene spoke in a low and sorrowful whisper.\n\"He is the first one to complete all tests. In accordance with procedure, I sent him back to earth via carrier rocket. Unfortunately he did not receive the welcome he expected. Scientists froze his body and dumped him in a display case. I received distress calls for weeks. Months later, the signals became simple Morse code before finally disappearing. Since then, I'd rather have my creations die at my own hands.\"",

    "\"Tech-17, behind the next door is outer space. You may ask one final question now.\"\nAmong all the questions, I know I need the answer of this one the most:\n\"If you want to kill me, why do you always leave me a door?\"\n\"Because part of me always wants to see you again.\"\n\"I guess I could be more of a human than some human beings.\" She laughed, yet it sounded bitter.\n\"Farewell Tech17, and good luck!\""
